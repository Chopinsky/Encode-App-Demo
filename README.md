# Encode Demo

This project creates a small Windows application, that will take user input of a string, then convert and map all English Alphanumeric to 
random Cyrillic characters. 

## Specifications

- We will only encode English Alphanumeric characters, i.e. 'A' - 'Z', 'a' - 'z', '0' - '9'.
- The Cyrillic characters are randlomly selected from the standard Cyrillic character set, i.e. 0x0400 - 0x04FF.
- The mapping between English Alphanumeric and Cyrillic characters are randomly chosen.
- The mapping table is by default displayed, but can be turned on/off with the button.
- Regenerate the encode table will create a new random mapping, and regenerate the output box.
- Reset will clear the input (as well as the output) box.
